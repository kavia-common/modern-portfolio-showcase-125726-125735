## About Me

I’m a product‑minded engineer who bridges design and development to build software that’s fast, reliable, and genuinely enjoyable to use. Over the past few years, I’ve shipped projects across consumer apps, internal tools, and data‑driven products—often from concept to production.

What I work with:
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Redux/Zustand, Tailwind, CSS Modules
- Backend: Node.js (Express/Nest), Python (FastAPI), REST/GraphQL, WebSockets
- Data & Infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma/SQLAlchemy, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), AWS
- Testing & Quality: Jest, Testing Library, Playwright, ESLint, Prettier

How I work:
- Product thinking first: I start with user goals and measurable outcomes.
- Design‑aware engineering: I prototype in code, iterate quickly, and refine via feedback.
- Performance & accessibility: Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals, and WCAG aren’t afterthoughts.
- Continuous learning: I document, teach, and contribute to open source when I can.

What drives me:
- Building experiences that feel effortless.
- Turning complex problems into clear, maintainable solutions.
- Creating tools that help people do their best work.

## Design & UX Guidance

Design goals:
- Modern, clean, and professional with strong hierarchy and ample whitespace.
- Accessible by default with excellent contrast, focus states, and keyboard support.
- Motion enhances meaning (no decorative-only animation) and respects reduced motion.

Color system (aligned with project theme):
- Light mode
  - Primary: #1a73e8
  - Secondary/backgrounds: #e8eaed / #f5f7fb
  - Accent: #4285f4
  - Text: #1a1a1a / #2b2b2b
- Dark mode
  - Background: #121212 / #1a1a1a
  - Surface: #202124
  - Primary/Accent: #4285f4
  - Text: #f5f5f5 / #e0e0e0
- Notes:
  - Use CSS variables for theming and a data-theme attribute toggle (already available).
  - Ensure 4.5:1 contrast on text; 3:1 minimum for large text and UI components.

Typography:
- Pairings:
  - Headings: Inter, Poppins, or Plus Jakarta Sans (600–700 weight)
  - Body: Inter, IBM Plex Sans, or System UI stack (400–500 weight)
- Scale:
  - H1 40–56px, H2 28–36px, H3 22–24px, body 16–18px, captions 13–14px
- Best practices:
  - Tight line-height for headings (1.15–1.25), comfortable for body (1.5–1.7).
  - Use letter-spacing slightly negative for large headings.

Layout:
- Fixed top nav with anchors: Hero, Projects, About, Skills, Blog, Contact.
- Section sizing: 80–120vh hero, ~72–96px vertical rhythm between sections.
- Container: max-width 1100–1200px with 24–32px side padding for mobile.
- Cards: project cards with image/preview, title, concise description, tech tags, and primary CTA (demo/code).

Motion & micro‑interactions:
- Entrance animations: fade+translateY(12–20px) using IntersectionObserver; stagger elements.
- Hover states: subtle scale (1.02), shadow elevation, and color tint for CTAs.
- Reduced motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion; use non-motion alternatives.
- Skeletons: display skeletons or blurred placeholders for images and dynamic content.

Projects presentation:
- Visual tags for tech stack (badge style).
- Key metrics (performance, adoption, or impact) surfaced near the title.
- Modal or dedicated page per project with “Problem → Approach → Outcome → Learnings” structure.

Skills visualization:
- Grouped badges; optionally add a compact progress/radar visualization (non‑numeric labels like “Proficient/Advanced/Expert”).
- Show “Recently learning” row to signal growth.

Accessibility checklist:
- Keyboard navigable with visible focus styles.
- Semantic HTML landmarks (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Color contrast validated; alt text for images; labels for inputs.
- Announce theme changes politely (aria-live if needed).

Performance checklist:
- Use responsive images, webp/avif, and native lazy loading.
- Code‑split by route/section; memoize expensive components.
- Preconnect to critical origins; cache fonts; self‑host when feasible.

Implementation tips for this codebase:
- Use the existing theme toggle (data-theme) and CSS variables in App.css.
- Create section components under src/sections (Hero.jsx, Projects.jsx, About.jsx, etc.) and import them in App.js.
- Use IDs for navigation anchors (e.g., id="projects").
- Store this markdown or transform portions into JSON for dynamic rendering.
